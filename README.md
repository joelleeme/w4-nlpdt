# Disaster Tweets Classification
## Project Overview
Twitter has become an important communication channel in times of emergency. The goal of this competition is to build a machine learning model that predicts which Tweets are about real disasters and which ones aren't.

## Models Used
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)
Simple Recurrent Neural Network (SimpleRNN)

## Repository Contents
- NLP_with_Disaster_Tweets.ipynb: Jupyter notebook used for data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.
